# Promises
In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A Promise is in one of these states:

- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
